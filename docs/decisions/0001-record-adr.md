# ADR-0001: Modular Architecture with Pagination Support

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The v0rtex web scraping framework needed to handle complex scraping scenarios including pagination, anti-detection measures, and extensible architecture. The team needed to decide on the core architectural patterns that would support these requirements while maintaining code quality and developer experience.

## Decision
We decided to implement a **modular architecture with pagination support** using the following design patterns:

1. **Facade Pattern** for the main scraper interface
2. **Strategy Pattern** for pagination handling
3. **State Machine Pattern** for session management
4. **Builder Pattern** for configuration management
5. **Factory Pattern** for pagination strategy creation

## Rationale

### Why Modular Architecture?
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each module has a single responsibility
- **Testability**: Individual components can be tested in isolation
- **Maintainability**: Changes to one module don't affect others
- **Extensibility**: New features can be added without modifying existing code
- **Team Development**: Multiple developers can work on different modules

### Why Strategy Pattern for Pagination?
- **Flexibility**: Different websites use different pagination methods
- **Extensibility**: New pagination strategies can be added easily
- **Maintainability**: Each strategy is self-contained
- **Testing**: Strategies can be tested independently
- **Runtime Selection**: Best strategy can be chosen automatically

### Why State Machine for Sessions?
- **Persistence**: Sessions can be saved and resumed
- **Recovery**: Failed scraping can be resumed from last known state
- **Progress Tracking**: Clear visibility into scraping progress
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and recovery

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Clean Architecture**: Well-defined interfaces between components
- **Easy Testing**: Mocking and unit testing is straightforward
- **Feature Development**: New features can be added incrementally
- **Documentation**: Architecture is easier to understand and document
- **Performance**: Components can be optimized independently

### Negative
- **Complexity**: More files and interfaces to manage
- **Learning Curve**: New developers need to understand the architecture
- **Overhead**: Some performance overhead from abstraction layers
- **Maintenance**: More files to maintain and update

### Risks
- **Over-engineering**: Risk of creating unnecessary abstractions
- **Interface Changes**: Changes to interfaces affect multiple components
- **Documentation Debt**: Architecture must be well-documented

```

### Key Interfaces

#### Pagination Strategy Interface
```python
class PaginationStrategy(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def can_handle(self, page: WebElement) -> bool:
        """Check if this strategy can handle the page."""
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def navigate_next(self, driver: WebDriver) -> bool:
        """Navigate to the next page."""
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def get_confidence(self) -> float:
        """Get confidence score for this strategy."""
        pass
```

#### Session State Interface
```python
class ScrapingSession:
    def save_state(self) -> None:
        """Save current session state to disk."""
        pass
    
    def load_state(self) -> None:
        """Load session state from disk."""
        pass
    
    def update_progress(self, page: int, items: int) -> None:
        """Update scraping progress."""
        pass
```

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Monolithic Architecture
- **Pros**: Simpler, fewer files, easier to understand
- **Cons**: Harder to test, maintain, and extend
- **Decision**: Rejected due to scalability concerns

### 2. Event-Driven Architecture
- **Pros**: Loose coupling, asynchronous processing
- **Cons**: Complex debugging, harder to reason about
- **Decision**: Rejected due to complexity overhead

### 3. Microservices Architecture
- **Pros**: Independent scaling, technology diversity
- **Cons**: Network overhead, deployment complexity
- **Decision**: Rejected due to overkill for current needs

## Review
This ADR should be reviewed:
- When adding new pagination strategies
- When modifying core interfaces
- When considering architectural changes
- Every 6 months for relevance
